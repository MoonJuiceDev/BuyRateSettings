- Massive thank you to my brother [Cryptoc1](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Cryptoc1/) for holding my hand

## v1.1.2
- Added a hidden, delayed rate setter - Sets the companyBuyRate variable a 2nd time after a 3 second delay to avoid the rate being overwritten by other mods at the start of a round or new quota. (NOTE: If you set the Alert Delay to less than 3 seconds, it may show the wrong rate in the alert. Just don't do that, that'd be weird.)
