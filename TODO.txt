Bugs:
- Quota refresh counter is reset upon closing the game and re-entering
- Quota refresh counter is not specific to the current save file
    - Fix both by utilizing save files ?

QoL:
- List reason refresh was denied
    - Just need some if statements
- Update refreshes remaining in terminal
    - Rework the entire goddamn terminal probably, cause it loads that text on Awake so it can't be changed later atm

Features:
- Add cost for using refresh command (BuyRateModifier.refreshCost.Value)
    - RPC bullshit with syncing credits, idk it broke the terminal when I tried Techy's method
