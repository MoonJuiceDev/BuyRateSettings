Heavily inspired by [Random Sell Prices](https://github.com/hatfielddr/Random-Sell-Prices) by [hatfielddr / BigDaddy](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BigDaddy/) (My main goal was to enhance this mod with more flexibility and remove the LC_API dependancy).

Made with [LethalCompany.Plugin.Sdk](https://github.com/Cryptoc1/lc-plugin-sdk) by [Cryptoc1](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Cryptoc1/).

## Known Issues / Compatibility

- Use the Alert Delay setting to avoid conflicts with other mods that trigger the same type of alert at the same time (BetterEXP, DiscountAlerts, etc)
